# hkdfguard-native-linux

Linux implementation of HKDFGuard: a stable C ABI for wrapping/unwrapping
32-byte Data Encryption Keys (DEKs) under a persistent, per-service Key
Encryption Key (KEK), using the strongest KEK backing available on the
host. Same cryptographic protocol and `service`-based key identity as the
macOS Secure Enclave and Windows TPM/CNG implementations of HKDFGuard.

```
ECDH (P-256, per-payload hashed point)  ->  HKDF-SHA512  ->  AES-256-GCM
```

A wrapped payload can only be **created** and **opened** on the host that
holds the KEK. The wrapping key is `ECDH(KEK_priv, H_salt)`, where
`H_salt` is a P-256 point hashed from the payload's random 32-byte salt
(try-and-increment; no one knows the discrete log of a hash output), so
producing a valid payload requires the KEK's private key — which never
leaves the TPM, HSM, or root-owned secret file. Because the point is
different for every payload, so is the raw ECDH secret `Z`: capturing
one `Z` (core dump, swap, a discrete TPM's bus) opens exactly that one
payload, not every payload the service has ever wrapped.

This is deliberately *not* ECIES. An ephemeral-key scheme would let
anyone holding the KEK's public key (not a secret — on a TPM, anyone who
can reach the device can recompute it) derive the same wrapping key and
mint a payload that unwraps to a DEK of their choosing. See
[`src/crypto.rs`](src/crypto.rs) for the full rationale, and note the
consequence: a build server **cannot** pre-wrap a DEK for a host. DEKs
are delivered to the host and wrapped there.

Wire format version 1. Every byte of a payload except the ciphertext is
bound into both the AEAD's associated data and the HKDF `info`, so the
`provider_type` tag and the KEK fingerprint are authenticated rather
than merely present.

## Quick start

```sh
scripts/build-release.sh
```

Runs `cargo build --release`, which produces
`target/release/libhkdfguard_v1.{so,dylib}` (dynamic) and
`libhkdfguard_v1.a` (static) -- the `[lib] name` in
`Cargo.toml` controls that output name directly, and Cargo has no way to
produce a name containing dots. The script's one additional step copies the
dynamic library to `target/release/HkdfGuard.Kms.Linux.v1.{so,dylib}` --
this project's actual release artifact name, matching the
`HkdfGuard.Kms.<platform>.v1` convention its Windows (CMake `OUTPUT_NAME`)
and macOS (Xcode `PRODUCT_NAME`) builds apply natively. A plain
`cargo build --release` still works for local iteration; just link against
`libhkdfguard_v1` directly in that case. On Linux the
library's SONAME is `libhkdfguard.so.1` ([`build.rs`](build.rs)), so a
program linked that way looks for that name at run time: the script also
creates it as a symlink in `target/release`. Installed from the packages
(see "Packages"), the library is simply `-lhkdfguard`, via
`pkg-config --cflags --libs hkdfguard`. The C header
(`include/hkdfguard.h`) and exported C symbols (`hkdfguard_create_kek`,
`hkdfguard_kek_exists`, `hkdfguard_wrap_dek`, `hkdfguard_unwrap_dek`,
`hkdfguard_generate_and_wrap_dek`) are unaffected either way and keep
their existing names.

```c
#include "hkdfguard.h"

/* Once, at startup: make sure the service has a KEK. This is the only
 * call that creates one -- wrap never does -- and it is deliberately
 * slow (see "Setup calls are deliberately slow"). Idempotent. */
hkdfguard_create_kek("com.company.orders");

uint8_t dek[32] = { ... };
uint8_t wrapped[512];
int wrapped_len = sizeof(wrapped);
hkdfguard_wrap_dek("com.company.orders", dek, 32, wrapped, &wrapped_len);

uint8_t recovered[32];
int recovered_len = sizeof(recovered);
hkdfguard_unwrap_dek("com.company.orders", wrapped, wrapped_len, recovered, &recovered_len);
```

`hkdfguard_wrap_dek` and `hkdfguard_generate_and_wrap_dek` return
`HKDFGUARD_ERR_KEK_NOT_FOUND` (`-9`) if `hkdfguard_create_kek` has never
succeeded for that `service`; `hkdfguard_kek_exists` reports whether it
has, without creating anything.

`hkdfguard_generate_and_wrap_dek` generates its own cryptographically random
32-byte DEK (via the OS CSPRNG) and wraps it in one call, for callers minting
a brand new DEK -- the plaintext never crosses back out to the caller; it's
zeroed internally the moment it's wrapped. Recover it later via
`hkdfguard_unwrap_dek` on the resulting payload, with the same `service`:

```c
uint8_t wrapped[512];
int wrapped_len = sizeof(wrapped);
hkdfguard_generate_and_wrap_dek("com.company.orders", wrapped, &wrapped_len);
```

### Hardening the host process (opt-in)

Keys and DEKs pass through your process's memory. `hkdfguard_harden_process`
makes that memory harder to recover: it disables core dumps (`RLIMIT_CORE`
set to 0, hard limit included) and calls `prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE, 0)`,
which also stops other non-root processes running as the same user from
attaching a debugger or reading `/proc/<pid>/mem`. Call it once, early,
and after any privilege drop (the kernel resets the flag when a
process's credentials change):

```c
if (hkdfguard_harden_process() != HKDFGUARD_OK) { /* refuse to start */ }
```

It is opt-in because it is process-wide: debuggers and crash reporters
stop working for your application. It does not stop root or a process
with `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`, and it does not keep memory out of swap; those are
host settings -- no swap or encrypted swap, `kernel.yama.ptrace_scope` of
2 or 3, and for a systemd service `LimitCORE=0` and
`ProtectProc=invisible`.

`hkdfguard-v1-initialize` always calls it, and refuses to run if it fails.
The CLI also locks its memory out of swap with `mlockall`, but only when
the process has `CAP_IPC_LOCK` or an unlimited `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` (root, or
`LimitMEMLOCK=infinity`). Under a finite limit, locking future
allocations could make one fail and abort the CLI mid-operation. In that
case it locks only the one small buffer that holds its copies of the DEK
(the base64 text it reads and the bytes that decodes to) with `mlock`, which
fits even a 64 KiB limit, and warns that the library's own transient
copies while it wraps are not locked.

See [`examples/wrap_unwrap.c`](examples/wrap_unwrap.c) for a complete,
buildable example, and [`include/hkdfguard.h`](include/hkdfguard.h) for the
full API contract (status codes, buffer sizing, safety requirements).

## Provider chain

`hkdfguard_create_kek` walks the policy-allowed providers in this order and
creates the `service`'s KEK on the first one that is available.
`hkdfguard_wrap_dek` walks the same order but only ever *loads*: it uses
the first provider that already holds a KEK for `service`, and never
creates one. `hkdfguard_unwrap_dek` always uses the exact provider that
originally wrapped the payload (recorded -- and authenticated -- in the
payload itself, never in `service`). Providers are constructed fresh on
every call; nothing is cached or kept open between calls.

The walk moves past a provider only when it is **absent** -- not on this
host, or not set up for use here -- or has **no key for this service**.
A provider that is present but failing ends the call with its error
instead: a secret file with the wrong owner or mode, a TPM that fails its
self-test or whose configured TCTI can't be opened, a PKCS#11 module that
won't load, a token label that matches nothing, a wrong PIN, a configured
secret mount that isn't there. Falling through in those cases would
quietly wrap every new DEK under a weaker KEK -- or, with Ephemeral, one
lost at the next restart -- with nothing reporting a problem.
`hkdfguard_kek_exists` fails the same way rather than answering 0, so a
caller isn't steered into creating a key somewhere weaker.

| Provider | Absent (the walk moves on) | Present but failing (the call fails) |
|---|---|---|
| TPM2 | default device can't be opened (no TPM, or not in `tss`); no derivation secret | leaky `TSS2_LOG`; unusable policy TCTI, or a configured one that can't be opened; untrusted secret; failed or unrunnable self-test |
| PKCS#11 | no module configured; no PIN file | untrusted PIN file; module refused or won't load; no matching token; `C_Initialize`/session/login failure |
| External secret | no mount found | configured `external_secret.dir` missing; a service's secret file present but untrusted |
| (any) | -- | policy present but unusable |

| # | Provider | Module | Feature flag | Built by default |
|---|----------|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1 | TPM2 | [`src/provider/tpm2.rs`](src/provider/tpm2.rs) | `tpm2` | no |
| 2 | PKCS#11 | [`src/provider/pkcs11.rs`](src/provider/pkcs11.rs) | `pkcs11` | no |
| 3 | External Secret | [`src/provider/external_secret.rs`](src/provider/external_secret.rs) | `external-secret` | yes |
| 4 | Ephemeral | [`src/provider/ephemeral.rs`](src/provider/ephemeral.rs) | `ephemeral` | yes |

There is deliberately no software-backed (locally-generated,
filesystem-encrypted-at-rest) provider: a deployment without TPM2 or
PKCS#11 hardware is expected to provision a KEK via external-secret
instead.

Ephemeral is compiled in by default but **never used unless a policy file
explicitly names it** -- either as the sole provider under `require`, or
by name in `preferred_order` (e.g. `preferred_order: [external-secret,
ephemeral]`). Qualifying by assurance tier under `require-level` is not
enough on its own; it must be named. Its keys live only in process
memory, so every DEK wrapped under one is lost on restart; without a
policy (or a policy that never names it), a missing secret mount or
unavailable TPM makes `hkdfguard_create_kek` fail rather than silently
degrade to it.

The policy file (`/etc/hkdfguard/policy.toml`) must be owned by root and
not writable by group or others, and so must `/etc/hkdfguard` and every
directory above it (sticky directories like `/tmp` and read-only mounts
excepted). The service's own user is deliberately not accepted: any
process running as that user could otherwise rewrite the policy, or
delete it to switch policy off. Only a *missing* file in a trusted
directory means "no policy"; a file that exists but is unreadable, too
broadly writable, wrongly owned, or malformed -- or one in a directory
someone untrusted could change -- makes every operation fail closed.
(Only test builds -- see "Testing against scratch configuration" -- also accept the process's own user.)

### Setup calls are deliberately slow

`hkdfguard_create_kek` and `hkdfguard_kek_exists` are meant to run once
per application startup, so each takes **at least one second** of
wall-clock time whatever its outcome (found, not found, or error), and
they are serialized with each other across threads. This bounds how fast
a buggy or hot-looping caller can drive the TPM/HSM (every call is a
fresh connection plus a key derivation) and caps Ephemeral key-map growth.
Argument errors (bad pointer, invalid service name) still return
immediately since they never reach a provider. The library logs a warning
once a process has made more than 10 setup calls.

The floor is about load, not secrecy. It does not hide which services
have a key: `hkdfguard_wrap_dek` is not rate-limited — it is the hot path
— and answers `KEK_NOT_FOUND` (`-3`) at once for a service with none, so
anything that can call the library can find out quickly. Treat service
names as public identifiers, never as secrets.

The floor is set by the policy file and can be tuned per host (up to
60 000 ms; `0` disables it):

```toml
[startup_behavior]
setup_min_delay_ms = 1000   # default when absent
```

A policy file that is present but invalid keeps the 1 s default (the
gated call fails closed on that same policy anyway). There is no
environment-variable override.

### Hardening the TPM key

The TPM provider derives each service's KEK with a deterministic
`TPM2_CreatePrimary` from the TPM's own primary seed plus a per-service
label. That makes the key unexportable and machine-bound, but on its own
it would also mean **any process that can open `/dev/tpmrm0` could issue
the same command and reproduce the same key.** An `authValue` cannot fix
that, because the authValue is not an input to the derivation — an
attacker simply re-derives the key with an authValue of their own.

Two controls close that gap:

**1. A host derivation secret (required by default).** The derived key
depends on the TPM seed *and* a file the attacker must also be able to
read. **The TPM provider refuses to run without it**, logging the exact
command to create it; provision it before first use:

```sh
install -d -m 0755 -o root -g root /etc/hkdfguard
( umask 077; head -c 32 /dev/urandom > /etc/hkdfguard/tpm.derivation-secret )
# For a service that doesn't run as root, let its group read it:
chgrp <service-group> /etc/hkdfguard/tpm.derivation-secret
chmod 0440 /etc/hkdfguard/tpm.derivation-secret
```

The secret must be owned by root, never by the service's own user: if
the service could write it, so could any process running as that user,
and changing it changes every TPM KEK. Group read is allowed only on a
root-owned file; nothing for others either way. The file's bytes are used
exactly as they are on disk — no newline trimming, because any trimming
rule would silently change the derived key for a secret ending in that
byte. A file that is present but untrustworthy (wrong owner, group-writable
or other-accessible, a symlink, empty, oversized, or in a directory
someone untrusted could change) is a hard error, never silently ignored.

To run without one, set `require_derivation_secret = false` under `[tpm]`
in the policy. The provider then derives from the TPM seed and service
name alone and logs a warning that any local process able to open the TPM
can reproduce the keys. Adding or removing the secret changes every TPM
KEK, so DEKs wrapped before the change fail their fingerprint check
(`-16`) -- decide before wrapping anything.

> **This changes the KEK.** Adding, removing, or altering the secret
> derives a different key, so DEKs wrapped beforehand will fail their
> fingerprint check (`-16`) rather than decrypt. Provision it before
> wrapping anything you need to keep.

> **Back up the derivation secret.** It is the one thing on a TPM host

> restore it byte-for-byte. A backup recovers from losing the *file*; it

> can trigger), resets the seed, and the old KEKs are gone with it. If

The secret is folded into the `TPM2_CreatePrimary` template's `unique`
field, which is the TPM's designed channel for influencing primary
derivation. (`inSensitive.data` would be the more obvious choice and does
not work: for an asymmetric key the TPM requires
`TPMA_OBJECT.sensitiveDataOrigin` to be SET, and clearing it to supply
sensitive data fails with `TPM_RC_ATTRIBUTES` — confirmed against swtpm.)

Because a TPM that ignored the extra input would leave the secret looking
configured while protecting nothing, the provider verifies empirically —
once per process — that the secret actually changes the derived key, and
refuses to use the TPM at all if it doesn't.

**2. Pinned TPM Names.** Record the Name your TPM reports for a service
and the provider will refuse any key whose Name differs. Unlike the
provider's own Name self-consistency check (which only catches a
non-conformant stack, since a Name is a public function of the public
area that anyone could recompute), this compares against a value held in
the root-owned policy file, so substitution is detectable.

```toml
[tpm.pinned_names]
"com.company.orders" = "000b<64 hex chars>"   # quote service names: unquoted dots make nested tables
```

Get the values to pin from the TPM itself with the two operator-helper
tests (see "Testing on a native Linux TPM" below; `scripts/native-tpm-test.sh`
runs them for you). They go through the production derivation, so a pin
learned *before* provisioning a derivation secret will not match after --
provision the secret first, then pin. Both controls fail closed: a policy
file that exists but can't be parsed is treated as requiring the secret,
and pinning errors rather than reporting "nothing pinned".

**Pinned Names as the provisioning allowlist.** A TPM has no stored
per-service state: `TPM2_CreatePrimary` derives a key for *any* service
name on demand. Left alone, that means on a TPM host `kek_exists` is
always true, `provision` always reports "already provisioned", and `wrap`
works for a service nobody ever provisioned — a typo in a deploy wraps
under a different key and is only discovered at unwrap. Setting
`require_pinned_names` moves the provisioning record into the root-owned
policy file:

```toml
[tpm]
require_pinned_names = true            # only services listed below exist on the TPM

[tpm.pinned_names]
"com.company.orders" = "000b<64 hex chars>"
```

Under it, a service with no pinned Name has no KEK: `kek_exists` returns
0, and wrap and unwrap fail. `provision` for such a service fails too, but
prints the exact entry to add — the Name this TPM derives for it, through
the production derivation (so with the derivation secret, if one is
configured):

```text
$ hkdfguard-v1-initialize provision -sn com.company.orders
error: hkdfguard: create_kek failed for service (redacted): provider error: TPM2: tpm.require_pinned_names
is set and this service has no pinned TPM Name. To provision it, add this to the policy file and run
provision again:
  [tpm.pinned_names]
  "com.company.orders" = "000b..."
error: hkdfguard_create_kek failed: the selected KEK provider failed (see the messages above for the provider's reason)
```

Add the entry as root and run `provision` again; it then reports
"already provisioned". The same entry also gives you substitution
protection (above), so one record does both jobs. A policy file that
exists but can't be parsed applies the allowlist rather than dropping it.

This gates the *TPM* provider. `provision` for an unpinned service fails
outright rather than creating the key elsewhere. But under
`mode = "prefer"`, wrap and unwrap treat an unpinned service like one the
TPM has no key for, so a weaker provider later in the order that *does*
hold a key for it can still serve it; pair the allowlist with
`mode = "require"`, `provider = "tpm2"` (or `mode = "require-level"`, `level = "hardware"`) if that matters. Don't
treat the allowlist as access control, either: anything that can open the
TPM and read the derivation secret can issue the same `CreatePrimary`
itself. What it buys is that the set of TPM services is explicit,
root-controlled, and checked on every call.

**3. Session parameter encryption (bus protection).** On a *discrete*
TPM — a separate chip on the LPC/SPI bus — an interposer can read
`TPM2_ECDH_ZGen`'s response, the shared secret, in cleartext. Each
response opens one payload (the per-payload hashed point keeps a
captured `Z` from opening any other), but an interposer that stays on
the bus captures every subsequent one. The provider can run that command inside
a salted HMAC session with parameter encryption (TPM 2.0 Part 1 §19.6;
the cryptography is tpm2-tss's ESAPI, not this crate's), so the secret
crosses the bus AES-128-CFB encrypted.

```toml
[tpm]
session_encryption = "auto"           # "auto" (default) | "required" | "off"
pinned_session_salt_key_name = "000b<64 hex chars>"
```

`auto` reads `TPM_PT_MANUFACTURER` and skips encryption only for TPMs
positively known to have no external bus (Intel PTT, AMD fTPM, Qualcomm,
Hyper-V/VMware/Google vTPMs, swtpm) — there is nothing to sniff inside an
SoC or a hypervisor, and the residual fTPM threats sit inside the TPM's
own trust boundary where transport encryption can't help. Unknown
vendors are encrypted. `required` always encrypts and **refuses to load
without a pinned salt-key Name**: an unsalted session's key is derivable
from bus-visible nonces, and even a salted one can be man-in-the-middled
if the attacker substitutes their own salt key at `TPM2_ReadPublic`, so
the pin is what makes `required` mean something. The salt key is a
deterministic primary with a fixed label, so its Name is stable and
pinnable; it carries no derivation secret and protects nothing by itself.

> **`auto` only defeats a passive listener.** The manufacturer it
> decides from is read over the same bus it is protecting. On a discrete
> TPM, an interposer that can *rewrite* traffic can answer `INTC`, and
> `auto` then sends `Z` in the clear. Without a pin, `auto` also accepts
> whatever salt key the bus delivers (and logs that once). So:
>
> - **Discrete TPM, or one you can't vouch for:** use `required` with a
>   pinned salt-key Name.
> - **Any `auto` policy with `pinned_session_salt_key_name` set always
>   encrypts**, whatever manufacturer the TPM reports — pinning is taken
>   as the statement that the bus is worth defending.
> - **Firmware TPM or vTPM you know is one:** `auto` without a pin is fine;
>   there is no bus to defend.

> **Known limitation on discrete TPMs:** parameter encryption covers only
> a command's *first* parameter, and `TPM2_CreatePrimary`'s first
> parameter is `inSensitive`, not `inPublic`. The derivation-secret-derived
> `unique` label therefore still crosses the bus in cleartext when the
> service key is re-created, and an interposer that captures it can
> re-derive the key. On a discrete TPM the derivation secret protects
> against software attackers only. Closing that needs a persisted,
> parent-encrypted key blob (`TPM2_Create` + `TPM2_Load`) instead of a
> derived primary.

Callers never see which provider is active. Every provider implements the
identical `ECDH -> HKDF-SHA512 -> AES-256-GCM` protocol
([`src/crypto.rs`](src/crypto.rs)); the only difference is where the
persistent P-256 KEK's private key lives and who performs the ECDH.

### Build & verification matrix

All of the below has actually been run, in Docker on Ubuntu 24.04 (glibc
2.39, tpm2-tss 4.0.1; `docker/run-tests.sh` -- see that section below),
not just reasoned about. Because the release binaries are built in that
same image, they need glibc 2.39 or newer: Ubuntu 24.04+, Debian 13, RHEL
10. Debian 12 is not a target -- its tpm2-tss is 3.2.1, even in backports.

| Feature | Builds on macOS (this repo's dev env) | Builds & links natively on Linux | Hardware/module test |
|---|---|---|---|
| `external-secret`, `ephemeral` (default) | yes | yes -- verified | unit tests pass; full wrap/unwrap round trip through the compiled C ABI (`examples/wrap_unwrap.c`) verified |
| `pkcs11` | yes (build-only; no module to talk to) | yes -- verified, linked against real `cryptoki` 0.6.2 + `libsofthsm2.so` | `#[ignore]`d tests pass against a real SoftHSM2 token: `C_GenerateKeyPair` + `CKM_ECDH1_DERIVE` executed for real, same key reproduced deterministically, and `CKM_ECDH1_DERIVE` against hashed per-payload points accepted |
| `tpm2` | **no** -- `tss-esapi-sys` ships pregenerated bindings only for specific Linux target tuples and hard-fails on macOS/aarch64 | yes -- verified, linked against real `libtss2-esys` 4.0.1 | The `#[ignore]`d conformance suite passes against a real `swtpm` instance: `TPM2_CreatePrimary` determinism and per-service uniqueness, the client-side Name formula matching the TPM's own, `TPM2_ECDH_ZGen` against hashed per-payload points, the derivation secret genuinely changing the derived key, and salted/parameter-encrypted sessions producing the same `Z` as plain ones. The same suite, plus the reboot-persistence check, has also been run via `scripts/native-tpm-test.sh` against real firmware TPMs: **Intel PTT** and **AMD fTPM** |

The TPM provider has been verified against `swtpm` and against two real
firmware TPMs, Intel PTT and AMD fTPM. It has **not** been exercised
against a discrete TPM chip (e.g. Infineon or Nuvoton) or against a
hardware HSM/YubiHSM -- the PKCS#11 provider has only ever been run
against SoftHSM2. `scripts/native-tpm-test.sh` (next section) exists
precisely so you can run the same matrix on your own hardware, including
a discrete chip, before depending on it.

Run the ignored hardware/module tests yourself once you have the real backend:

```sh
cargo test --features tpm2 -- --ignored     # needs a TPM or swtpm, on Linux
cargo test --features pkcs11 -- --ignored   # needs SoftHSM2 or another PKCS#11 module
```

### Testing on a native Linux TPM (Intel PTT / AMD fTPM / discrete)

Docker proves the code against `swtpm`. This repo's maintainers have run
the scripts below to completion, including reboot persistence, on real
**Intel PTT** and **AMD fTPM** firmware TPMs. A **discrete** TPM (e.g.
Infineon, Nuvoton) has not yet been tested -- the code path exists (see
the known limitation on parameter encryption below) but is unverified
against real discrete hardware. To prove it against the hardware you
will actually deploy on:

```sh
scripts/native-tpm-preflight.sh   # read-only: device access, tpm2-tools, libtss2-esys, vendor
scripts/native-tpm-test.sh        # the full matrix, on the real TPM
```

The preflight identifies the TPM from `TPM2_PT_MANUFACTURER` and tells you
what `session_encryption = "auto"` will decide on it (skip for an
fTPM/vTPM, encrypt for a discrete chip). The full run then does everything
`docker/entrypoint-test.sh` does, against the real device: the
conformance suite (determinism, Name formula, the fixed ECDH point,
encrypted-session correctness), the same suite again with a derivation
secret provisioned, a C ABI round trip with the KEK on the TPM under both
`auto` and a fully pinned `required` policy, and the CLI-to-C-consumer
cross-process check. It learns the Names to pin from the TPM itself via
two operator-helper tests (run them directly to get values for your own
policy):

```sh
cargo test --features tpm2 --lib print_session_salt_key_name_for_pinning -- --ignored --nocapture
HKDFGUARD_PIN_SERVICE=com.company.orders \
cargo test --features tpm2 --lib print_service_key_name_for_pinning -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Nothing under `/etc/hkdfguard` is touched and no state is left on the
TPM. On a discrete chip one fTPM-specific assertion is skipped (the
mechanism it exercises still runs).

The one property `swtpm` can only approximate is survival of a real
reboot. For that:

```sh
scripts/native-tpm-test.sh reboot capture   # wraps a DEK on the TPM and saves state
# reboot the machine
scripts/native-tpm-test.sh reboot verify    # the same KEK must re-derive and unwrap it
```

### Testing in Docker (recommended if you're not already on Linux)

```sh
docker/run-tests.sh
```

Builds a real Linux environment with `tpm2-tss`, `swtpm`, and `SoftHSM2`
and runs the full matrix end-to-end, in this order: the default-feature
unit, CLI, and integration tests; a real link against `libtss2-esys` and
the PKCS#11 loader; the `tpm2`-feature unit tests; the `#[ignore]`d TPM
conformance suite against swtpm; the `#[ignore]`d PKCS#11 tests against a
fresh SoftHSM2 token; a C ABI round trip through the release `.so`; and the
CLI flow (`provision`, then `wrap` via stdin and `--dek-file`, with the
retired `--dek` and an unprovisioned `wrap` both asserted to be refused)
unwrapped by a separate C consumer. Every change in this repo is expected
to pass it. See [`docker/README.md`](docker/README.md).

## Packages (.deb / .rpm)

```sh
packaging/build-packages.sh     # needs Docker; DISTROS=debian ARCHES=amd64 for a subset
```

Builds packages for **Debian 13** (`.deb`) and **EL10** -- RHEL 10,
AlmaLinux 10, Rocky Linux 10 (`.rpm`) -- on amd64/x86_64 and
arm64/aarch64, into `dist/packages/<distro>-<arch>/`. Each build runs on
its own distribution (built against that distribution's glibc and
tpm2-tss), runs the default and all-features test suites, and is then
installed into a clean container of that distribution and exercised by
[`packaging/smoke-test.sh`](packaging/smoke-test.sh). CI does the same in
the `packages` job and attaches the packages to tagged releases. Debian 12
and RHEL 9 are not targets: both ship tpm2-tss 3.x.

| Debian | RPM | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `libhkdfguard1` | `hkdfguard-libs` | `libhkdfguard.so.1`, the `HkdfGuard.Kms.Linux.v1.so` name, an empty `/etc/hkdfguard` (root, `0755`), README, third-party licenses |
| `libhkdfguard-dev` | `hkdfguard-devel` | `hkdfguard.h`, `libhkdfguard.so`, `hkdfguard.pc` |
| (in `libhkdfguard-dev`) | `hkdfguard-static` | `libhkdfguard.a` |
| `hkdfguard` | `hkdfguard` | `hkdfguard-v1-initialize` and its man page |

All are built with every provider enabled, so the library depends on
tpm2-tss's libraries even on hosts without a TPM. The PKCS#11 module is
only ever loaded at run time, from the policy file. The packages install
no policy file, derivation secret or PIN: those are per-host decisions
(see "Configuration"), and with no policy file the library uses its
defaults.

The version lives in three places -- `Cargo.toml`, `debian/changelog` and
`packaging/rpm/hkdfguard.spec` (`Version` and `%changelog`) -- and
[`packaging/check-version.sh`](packaging/check-version.sh) fails every
package build, and any release tag, where they disagree. The library's
SONAME major (`.1`, in `build.rs`) is separate: it changes only with an
incompatible C ABI change, together with the Debian package name
`libhkdfguard1`.

## External-secret file requirements

For the external-secret provider the mounted file *is* the KEK private
key, so it is held to the same standard as the PKCS#11 PIN and the TPM
derivation secret. `<mount>/<service>` must:

- be **owned by root or by the process's user**, with **no group or other
  access** — `0400` or `0600`;
- be a **regular file** (not a directory, device, or FIFO);
- **resolve to a path inside the mount.** Symlinks are followed —
  Kubernetes Secret volumes present every key as a symlink into `..data/`,
  and refusing that would refuse the most common delivery mechanism — but
  only while the resolution stays within the mount directory. A link
  leading anywhere else is refused;
- sit in a **mount nobody else can write to**: the mount directory and
  every directory above it must be owned by root or the process's user and
  not writable by group or others. Sticky ancestors (`/tmp`) and read-only
  mounts — a Kubernetes Secret volume is `1777` but read-only — are fine. A
  mount another user could write to would let them plant a KEK for a
  service that isn't provisioned yet, which `create_kek` would then adopt.

A file that is present but fails a check is reported as an **error**,
never as "not provisioned": a misconfigured mount must not silently fall
through to a weaker provider. `hkdfguard_kek_exists` surfaces it the same
way.

Every common mechanism meets the mode requirement with one setting:

| Mechanism | Setting |
|---|---|
| Kubernetes `Secret` volume | `defaultMode: 0400` on the volume (files are root-owned) |
| Vault Agent template/sink | `perms = "0400"` |
| Docker Swarm secret | `mode: 0400` (the default `0444` is refused) |
| CSI Secrets Store | `defaultMode`/file permission in the `SecretProviderClass` |
| systemd `LoadCredential=` | already `0400`, root-owned — works as-is |

> **Kubernetes `fsGroup` caveat:** setting `fsGroup` on the pod can add
> group-read to secret files even with `defaultMode: 0400`, which the
> provider refuses. Either leave `fsGroup` unset for the secret volume,
> or use `fsGroupChangePolicy: OnRootMismatch` with an owner that matches
> the process's user.

## Initializing a wrapped key (`hkdfguard-v1-initialize`)

Because a wrapped payload can only be produced on the host that holds the
KEK, a deployment pipeline delivers the *plaintext* DEK to the host and
wraps it there. This CLI is that step, in two deliberately separate
commands:

```sh
# 1. Once, at deployment time: ensure the service has a KEK. This is the
#    only command that makes the (deliberately slow) setup calls.
hkdfguard-v1-initialize provision --service-name com.company.orders

# 2. Wrap a DEK under it. Never creates a KEK: if none is provisioned it
#    fails and names the command above.
printf '%s' "$DEK_B64" | hkdfguard-v1-initialize wrap \
    --key-file-path /var/lib/app/key.bin \
    --service-name com.company.orders --dek-stdin

# ...or from a file: a Kubernetes/Vault secret mount, or a systemd credential
hkdfguard-v1-initialize wrap \
    --key-file-path /var/lib/app/key.bin \
    --service-name com.company.orders \
    --dek-file "$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY/dek"
```

`provision` is idempotent: it checks first and reports "already
provisioned" without touching an existing KEK. On a TPM the KEK is derived
on demand, so it always reports present; for `external-secret` the mounted
file *is* the provisioning; only Ephemeral actually creates anything.

The DEK is base64 of exactly 32 bytes, read from stdin or a file — never
from a command-line argument or an environment variable, both of which are
readable by any process running as the same user (`/proc/<pid>/cmdline`,
`/proc/<pid>/environ`). `printf` is a shell builtin, so the DEK never
reaches any argv.

`wrap --force` completes the wrap in memory *before* it securely
overwrites and replaces the existing key file, so a wrap that fails — no
KEK, provider unavailable, bad input — never destroys the key file that
was already there. It only ever overwrites a regular file at that exact
path: a symlink there is refused rather than followed (following it would
overwrite whatever it points to), as are a directory, FIFO, or device, and
any file far larger than a wrapped key. The overwrite is best-effort: on
copy-on-write or log-structured filesystems (btrfs, ZFS) and on flash
storage, old blocks can survive it.

The key file is written `0600`, owned by whoever runs the command. It is
ciphertext, but anyone who can read it *and* reach the provider — on a TPM
host, any member of `tss` — can unwrap it, so nothing beyond its owner is
granted by default. If the service that reads it runs as a different user,
run `wrap` as that user, or `chown`/`chmod` the file deliberately.

A `--dek-file` must be a regular file, not a symlink, owned by root or by
the invoking user, with no group or other access (e.g. `0400`/`0600`) — the
same rules the library applies to the PKCS#11 PIN and the TPM derivation
secret. One trailing newline is ignored on both paths.

> The remaining exposure is upstream of this tool: don't put the DEK in an
> environment variable, and don't pipe it with an `echo` that resolves to
> `/bin/echo` (argv again). `printf` as a shell builtin is safe.

## Configuration

Every setting -- which TPM, which derivation secret, which secret mount,
which PKCS#11 module, token and PIN file -- comes from one root-owned file,
the policy at `/etc/hkdfguard/policy.toml` (see "Policy file reference"), or
a built-in default. Nothing in the environment can redirect any of it, in
any build that ships -- release or debug. The environment is often set by
lower-trust configuration than `/etc/hkdfguard` (a unit drop-in, a pod
spec), and whoever picks the TPM picks who knows its seed. A build that
finds `HKDFGUARD_POLICY_FILE` set ignores it and logs a warning.

The only environment variable the library acts on:

| Env var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `TSS2_LOG` | tpm2-tss's own log level. If it sets `debug` or `trace` for any module, the TPM provider **refuses to run**: at those levels tpm2-tss logs raw TPM commands and responses (including ECDH shared secrets), session keys, and plaintext parameters, and `TSS2_LOGFILE` can send that to any path. `info` and below are fine. |

### Testing against scratch configuration

Tests need their own policies, pointing at simulators, scratch secrets and
SoftHSM2. They get them without anything being redirectable in a real
build:

- **This crate's unit tests** use `policy::test_support::TestPolicy`, which
  exists only under `cfg(test)`. Each test writes its own policy into a
  private temp directory -- layered over the harness's, below -- and the
  library reads it through exactly the production path (ownership,
  location, and parse checks included). It is removed when the test ends.
  With no harness policy, unit tests read *no* policy, so a real
  `/etc/hkdfguard` on the machine never leaks in.
- **Everything run as a separate process** -- the CLI's own tests, the
  integration tests, the C examples -- uses a library built with
  `RUSTFLAGS="--cfg hkdfguard_test_paths"`. Only such a build reads
  `HKDFGUARD_POLICY_FILE` (and accepts config owned by the invoking user
  rather than root), and it says so in its log. No ordinary build setting
  -- a cargo feature, a profile, `--all-features` -- can turn it on, and
  nothing that ships is built with it. Without it, the tests that need it
  are reported as ignored, naming the flag.

`scripts/native-tpm-test.sh`, `docker/entrypoint-test.sh` and CI build these
into `target/test-paths`, write a harness policy naming the TPM, a scratch
derivation secret and the SoftHSM2 token, and point
`HKDFGUARD_POLICY_FILE` at it. To do the same by hand:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS="--cfg hkdfguard_test_paths" CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target/test-paths \
  HKDFGUARD_POLICY_FILE=/path/to/scratch-policy.toml \
  cargo test --features tpm2 -- --ignored --test-threads=1
```

Secrets are never read from environment variables (`/proc/<pid>/environ`
is readable by same-user processes and inherited by children); every
secret is a file named in the policy, and every such file is checked on the
opened descriptor for ownership, mode, and type before its contents are
trusted.

### Policy file reference

Everything the policy file (`/etc/hkdfguard/policy.toml`) accepts, in one
place. It is [TOML](https://toml.io). Unknown keys are rejected. Every
field is optional except `[selection]`; the values shown are the defaults
where one exists.

Two TOML rules matter here. Top-level keys (`preferred_order`) must come
before the first `[table]` header: written below one, they belong to that
table and the file is rejected. And service names in `[tpm.pinned_names]`
must be quoted: an unquoted `com.company.orders` is a dotted key meaning
nested tables, which is also rejected.

```toml
preferred_order = ["tpm2", "pkcs11", "external-secret"]
                                    # with `prefer`: try in this order; omitted providers are excluded.
                                    # This is also the ONLY way Ephemeral is ever used: it must be named here
                                    # (or be the `require` provider). With no policy file at all, the order is
                                    # tpm2, pkcs11, external-secret -- and never ephemeral.

[key_requirements]
minimum_protection = "external"     # ephemeral | software | external | hardware; providers below this tier are excluded

[selection]
mode = "prefer"                     # require | require-level | prefer
provider = "tpm2"                   # with `require`: exactly this provider (tpm2 | pkcs11 | external-secret | ephemeral)
level = "hardware"                  # with `require-level`: any provider at this tier or above

[startup_behavior]
setup_min_delay_ms = 1000           # floor on create_kek/kek_exists latency; 0 disables, max 60000
fail_if_requirement_unmet = true    # accepted for schema parity; the library always fails closed regardless

[tpm]
require_derivation_secret = true    # refuse the TPM without /etc/hkdfguard/tpm.derivation-secret; false warns instead
require_pinned_names = false        # true: only services in pinned_names exist on the TPM (provisioning allowlist)
session_encryption = "auto"         # auto | required | off  (see "Session parameter encryption")
pinned_session_salt_key_name = "000b<64 hex>"   # mandatory under `required`
tcti = "device:/dev/tpmrm0"         # which TPM: device:<path> | tabrmd:<conf> | mssim:<conf> | swtpm:<conf>
derivation_secret_file = "/etc/hkdfguard/tpm.derivation-secret"  # absolute path; root-owned, 0400 (or 0440 with the service's group)

[tpm.pinned_names]                  # per-service expected TPM Name; refuse any other key
"com.company.orders" = "000b<64 hex>"

[external_secret]
dir = "/var/run/secrets/hkdfguard"  # where <service> KEK files live; when set, the only place looked
                                    # (default: first existing of the four conventional mounts)

[pkcs11]
module = "/usr/lib/vendor/libhsm-pkcs11.so"   # PKCS#11 is used only when this is set (no default search); root-owned
pin_file = "/etc/hkdfguard/pkcs11.pin"        # root-owned 0400, or 0440 with the service's group; this is the default
token_label = "hkdfguard-prod"      # choose the token by label and/or serial; exactly one must match.
token_serial = "0123456789abcdef"   # with neither, exactly one initialized token must be present
```

The policy file must be owned by root and not writable by group or
others, in directories only root can change. So must the PIN file, which
additionally may be read by nobody but root and, optionally, the
service's group: a PIN file the service could write would let any process
running as that user write a wrong PIN and lock the HSM user out. The
PKCS#11 module, its directory, and every directory above it must be
root-owned and not group/other-writable (sticky ancestors excepted), so
nothing on the module's path can be swapped before it is `dlopen`ed.

Only a *missing* file means "no policy"; a present but
unreadable, too-broadly-writable, or malformed file makes every operation
fail closed -- and resolves each hardening knob to its strictest setting
(`session_encryption = "required"`, derivation secret required) rather than
its default.

## Design decisions worth knowing

- **Wire format is hand-rolled, not `serde`+`bincode`.** The wrapped
  payload ([`src/payload.rs`](src/payload.rs)) is security-critical: it
  is the AAD input as well as the on-disk layout, so every field width
  and order is pinned explicitly rather than left to a serialization
  library's derive output, which could silently change across a
  dependency bump. 
- **Pure-Rust crypto (`p256`/`hkdf`/`aes-gcm`), not OpenSSL**, for the
  protocol itself. No system OpenSSL version skew across distros, trivial
  static linking (`libhkdfguard_v1.a`), and RustCrypto's P-256/HKDF-SHA512/
  AES-256-GCM implementations satisfy the mandated algorithm list exactly.
  TPM2 and PKCS#11 still, necessarily, link against their respective
  native libraries.
- **TPM2 KEKs are deterministic `CreatePrimary` outputs, not persistent
  handles.** Rather than using `EvictControl` to persist a child key into
  the TPM's limited persistent-handle range (which needs an owner-auth
  session and a local `service -> handle number` mapping to protect and
  never lose), each service's KEK is produced by `TPM2_CreatePrimary`
  with the public template's `unique` field set to a hash of the service
  name -- and, once provisioned, of the host derivation secret (see
  "Hardening the TPM key"). `CreatePrimary` is deterministic for a fixed
  hierarchy/template, so this reproduces the exact same key on demand from
  the TPM's own internal primary seed -- no persistent-handle bookkeeping,
  no exhaustion risk, nothing to lose. See the module doc in
  [`src/provider/tpm2.rs`](src/provider/tpm2.rs) for the full rationale
  and why this is not the kind of "derive a KEK from a machine
  fingerprint" construction the spec prohibits (the secret input is the
  TPM's seed; `service` is only a public domain-separation label, exactly
  like it already is for HKDF `info`). The consequence worth knowing: on a
  TPM every service's KEK "already exists" the moment the TPM is
  reachable, so `hkdfguard_kek_exists` is always true there and
  `provision` always reports already-provisioned.
- **The external-secret provider never creates keys, only loads them**,
  and declines per-service (not globally) when nothing is provisioned for
  a given `service`. `hkdfguard_create_kek` then continues down the
  policy-allowed chain; if nothing there can create one -- and Ephemeral
  is never a candidate unless the policy names it -- the call fails with
  `HKDFGUARD_ERR_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` rather than quietly producing a key
  that would be lost on restart.
- **Nothing is cached between calls.** Providers are constructed fresh on
  every call and dropped after it; there are no standing TPM or PKCS#11
  sessions, no memoized provider selection, and the policy file is re-read
  from disk each time. The only per-process state is a handful of facts
  about the *hardware* (the TPM conformance verdict, whether it honors the
  derivation secret, and its manufacturer) that cannot change underneath a
  running process. This is deliberate: the most secret parts of the system
  are re-authenticated on every use rather than held open.
- **Unwrap always uses the provider recorded in the payload**, not
  whichever provider is currently strongest -- and that provider tag is
  authenticated, so it cannot be steered. If it differs from what policy
  would pick today, a debug-level migration hint is logged so operators
  know it's time to re-wrap onto the stronger provider.

## Security properties

- **No Rust type, TPM handle, OpenSSL structure, or PKCS#11 object crosses
  the C ABI.** Only `int`/`uint8_t*`/`char*`.
- **No panic ever unwinds across the ABI.** Every exported function is
  wrapped in `catch_unwind`; a caught panic returns `HKDFGUARD_ERR_INTERNAL_ERROR`.
- **DEK plaintext is stack-only, never heap, during wrap/unwrap.**
  `crypto.rs` uses `AeadInPlace::{encrypt,decrypt}_in_place_detached` on a
  stack-allocated `[u8; 32]` instead of the more convenient
  `Aead::{encrypt,decrypt}`, which internally allocates a heap `Vec<u8>`
  for exactly this data.
- **Private key material never leaves the TPM or the PKCS#11 token.**
  `Tpm2Handle`/`Pkcs11Handle` hold no key bytes at all -- only a service
  name and a connection; `ecdh()` asks the device/token to compute the
  shared point and only the (non-reversible) result crosses back.
- **Every secret file is checked on its opened descriptor, never by path.**
  The policy file, the PKCS#11 PIN, the TPM derivation secret, an
  external-secret KEK, and the CLI's `--dek-file` all go through the same
  discipline (`src/secure_file.rs`): open, then `fstat` the descriptor for
  regular-file type, ownership, and mode, so nothing can be swapped between
  the check and the read. The policy, PIN, and derivation secret must be
  root-owned (in every build but the test ones), in directories only root can change, so
  the service's own uid can't rewrite (or delete) them. Secret contents are read into a single fixed
  allocation that is never grown (so no partially-filled buffer is ever
  freed un-wiped) and zeroed on every exit path.
- **Service names can never name a file outside their mount.** The C ABI
  rejects a `service` that starts with `.` or contains `..`, and the
  external-secret provider enforces the same rule again where the name
  becomes a path -- plus a containment check that any symlink it follows
  resolves inside the mount directory.
- **Every other point a secret transits a heap buffer is explicitly
  zeroized**, not left to an incidental `Drop`: the ECDH shared secret and
  derived AES key (`Zeroizing<[u8; 32]>` throughout), the raw bytes read
  from a PKCS#11 token attribute, and the external-secret provider's
  mounted secret-file bytes.
- **On any `hkdfguard_unwrap_dek` failure, the caller's entire declared
  output buffer is zeroed** before returning -- no partial or stale key
  material is ever left behind.
- **KEKs are always cryptographically random**, generated by the provider
  (TPM RNG, PKCS#11 token RNG, or `OsRng`) -- never derived from hostname,
  machine ID, MAC address, container ID, or any other host fingerprint.
  The one necessary exception is the Ephemeral provider, whose whole
  design requires keeping generated keys in a heap-resident map for the
  life of the process; those keys still zeroize on drop
  (`elliptic_curve::SecretKey` implements `ZeroizeOnDrop`), but by
  definition can't be stack-only across calls.
- **Logging** (via the `log` crate) covers provider selection, provider
  initialization, migration events, and error codes -- never DEKs, KEKs,
  shared secrets, HKDF output, plaintext, or ciphertext.
