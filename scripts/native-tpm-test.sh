# Full hkdfguard test matrix on a native Linux machine with a real TPM
# (Intel PTT, AMD fTPM, or a discrete chip) -- the same sections as
# docker/entrypoint-test.sh, but against the hardware you will deploy on
# instead of swtpm, plus the things only real hardware can prove.
#
#   scripts/native-tpm-test.sh                 full matrix (default)
#   scripts/native-tpm-test.sh reboot capture  wrap a DEK on the TPM, save state, then reboot the machine
#   scripts/native-tpm-test.sh reboot verify   after the reboot: the same KEK must re-derive and unwrap it,
#                                              then delete the saved state
#   scripts/native-tpm-test.sh reboot clean    delete the saved state without verifying
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. Preflight (scripts/native-tpm-preflight.sh).
#   2. Build with --features tpm2 (and pkcs11 if SoftHSM2 is installed).
#   3. Unit tests for the tpm2 feature (no device needed).
#   4. The #[ignore]d conformance suite against the REAL TPM: CreatePrimary
#      determinism, per-service uniqueness, Name formula, acceptance of the
#      hashed per-payload ECDH points, salted/encrypted session correctness,
#      auto-mode, and the runtime "does this TPM honor the derivation
#      secret" self-test. A derivation secret is required by default, so
#      the script provisions one (see Environment below).
#   5. The same suite again under a second, different derivation secret:
#      every service key changes, and everything must still pass.
#   6. Learns the salt-key and service-key Names from the TPM (the operator
#      helpers in src/provider/tpm2.rs) and writes a policy that REQUIRES
#      encrypted sessions with both Names pinned.
#   7. C ABI round trip (examples/wrap_unwrap.c) against the .so
#      with the KEK on the TPM -- once under `auto`, once under that
#      `required` + pinned policy.
#   8. CLI -> separate C consumer: hkdfguard-v1-initialize wraps via stdin,
#      cli_unwrap_check unwraps through the .so. Cross-process persistence
#      on the real TPM.
#   9. If SoftHSM2 is present: the pkcs11 conformance suite.
#
# Everything is configured the way production is -- by a policy file --
# except that the file lives in this script's temp dir. A library only reads
# a policy other than /etc/hkdfguard/policy.toml when built with
# `--cfg hkdfguard_test_paths`, so everything here (tests, the .so, and the
# CLI the C examples use) is built that way, into its own target directory
# (target/test-paths) so it never mixes with an ordinary build. Nothing that
# ships is ever built with that flag.
#
# Nothing under /etc/hkdfguard is read or written, and the TPM is only ever
# asked to derive transient primaries (flushed after use), so nothing is
# left on the TPM. A full run keeps every policy and secret file in a temp
# dir it removes on exit. `reboot` cannot: what it captures must survive
# the reboot, so `reboot capture` saves a derivation secret, a plaintext
# test DEK, and its wrapped copy in the state dir (below) -- together
# enough to re-derive that test service's key on this TPM. `reboot verify`
# deletes them once it passes (it keeps them on failure, so it can be
# rerun), and `reboot clean` deletes them without verifying.
#
# Options (read by this script; the library reads none of them):
#   HKDFGUARD_TCTI               override the TCTI (default from preflight)
#   HKDFGUARD_NATIVE_TEST_STATE  where `reboot capture` saves its state
#                                (default: ${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/hkdfguard-native-tpm-test)
#   HKDFGUARD_TPM_DERIVATION_SECRET_FILE
#                                the derivation secret to put in the policies.
#                                If unset, the script creates one: in its temp
#                                dir for a full run, and in the state dir for
#                                `reboot`, where capture and verify must share it.
