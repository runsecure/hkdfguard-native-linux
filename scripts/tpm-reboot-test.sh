# Approximates TPM reboot/persistence testing for hkdfguard's TPM2
# provider: TPM2_CreatePrimary's determinism (see the design note in
# src/provider/tpm2.rs) means a primary key derived from a fixed template
# must reproduce identically even after the emulated TPM process itself
# is stopped and restarted, as long as its state directory (where swtpm
# persists the primary seed) survives.
#
# This is an approximation, not a literal invocation of hkdfguard's own
# Rust code: it drives tpm2-tools directly against a plain default ECC
# template rather than reimplementing src/provider/tpm2.rs's exact
# per-service SHA-256(service) `unique`-field derivation in shell. That
# per-service differentiation is already covered, in-process and without
# needing a real restart, by the `#[ignore]`d
# different_services_produce_different_public_keys /
# _names tests in src/provider/tpm2.rs. What only an actual restart can
# exercise -- and what this script is for -- is whether CreatePrimary's
# output for a *fixed* template survives that restart at all.
#
# Workflow:
#   1. Start swtpm with persistent state.
#   2. Capture a primary's public area + Name.
#   3. Stop swtpm.
#   4. Restart swtpm using the same state directory.
#   5. Capture again.
#   6. Assert both captures are identical.
#
# Requires `swtpm`/`swtpm-tools` and `tpm2-tools` on PATH (see
# docker/Dockerfile, or docker/docker-compose.yml's `swtpm` service for a
# containerized alternative). Exact tpm2-tools flag names/output can vary
# slightly by version; this was written against the tpm2-tools release in
# docker/Dockerfile (Ubuntu 24.04) and not independently re-verified
# against every other version.
#
# Usage: scripts/tpm-reboot-test.sh
#
# For the real thing -- a genuine reboot of a machine with a real TPM,
# driving hkdfguard's own code rather than a stand-in template -- use
# `scripts/native-tpm-test.sh reboot capture`, reboot, then
# `scripts/native-tpm-test.sh reboot verify`.
