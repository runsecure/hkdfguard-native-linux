/*
 * hkdfguard.h -- Stable C ABI for hkdfguard-native-linux.
 *
 * Wraps and unwraps 32-byte Data Encryption Keys (DEKs) under a persistent,
 * per-service Key Encryption Key (KEK), using the strongest available
 * provider on the host (TPM2 > PKCS#11 > external secret > ephemeral).
 * See the crate's provider/ module docs for the protocol
 * (ECDH P-256 against a per-payload hashed point -> HKDF-SHA512 -> AES-256-GCM) and
 * provider details. A wrapped payload can only be created, and only be
 * opened, on the host holding the KEK: it is not possible to pre-wrap a
 * DEK for a host from elsewhere.
 *
 * No Rust type, TPM handle, OpenSSL structure, or PKCS#11 object ever
 * crosses this boundary. No exception/panic ever crosses this boundary --
 * every function below returns a plain status code.

 * and after any privilege change (the kernel resets the dumpable flag
 * when credentials change). Root and CAP_SYS_PTRACE are unaffected; that

/*
 * Ensures a persistent KEK exists for `service`, creating one (on the
 * strongest available, policy-allowed provider) if it does not already.
 * Idempotent: safe to call again for a `service` that already has one --
 * this just confirms it's still there, doesn't rotate or recreate it.
 *
 * This is the *only* way a KEK ever gets created: hkdfguard_wrap_dek and
 * hkdfguard_generate_and_wrap_dek both return HKDFGUARD_ERR_KEK_NOT_FOUND
 * if called before this for a given `service`.
 *
 * TPM2 exception: the TPM derives a KEK for any service on demand, so by
 * default every service already "exists" there and this call has nothing
 * to create. With `tpm.require_pinned_names: true` in the policy file, a
 * service exists on the TPM only if policy pins its Name; for an unpinned
 * service this call fails and logs (at error level) the exact policy entry
 * to add. Provisioning on TPM is that root-owned policy edit.
 *
 * Deliberately slow: this and hkdfguard_kek_exists are setup calls, meant
 * to run once per application startup, and each takes at least
 * `startup_behavior.setup_min_delay_ms` (policy file; default 1000 ms)
 * of wall-clock time whatever its outcome, and they are serialized with
 * each other across threads. Do not call them per request; call once at
 * startup and then use hkdfguard_wrap_dek / hkdfguard_unwrap_dek.
 * Argument errors (bad pointer or service name) return immediately.

/*

 *           disallowed character, or a dot rule violation all return
 *           HKDFGUARD_ERR_INVALID_SERVICE_NAME. Case-insensitive: normalized
 *           to lowercase internally, so e.g. "Com.Example.Orders" and

 *           (after normalization) service strings always resolve to
 *           different KEKs.
 * dek:      pointer to exactly `dek_len` bytes to wrap.
 * dek_len:  must be exactly HKDFGUARD_DEK_LEN (32); any other value
 *           returns HKDFGUARD_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT.
 * out:      buffer to receive the wrapped payload. May be NULL only if
 *           *out_len is 0 (to probe the required size).
 * out_len:  in: capacity of `out` in bytes.
 *           out: on HKDFGUARD_OK, the number of bytes written to `out`.
 *                on HKDFGUARD_ERR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, the required capacity;
