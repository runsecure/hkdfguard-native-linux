//! Hardened reads of security-sensitive files (the administrative policy,
//! the PKCS#11 PIN, externally provisioned KEK material) and a buffer type
//! that guarantees what was read is wiped once it's no longer needed.
//!
//! Two properties every caller relies on:
//!
//! - **Checks are made on the opened descriptor, not the path.** Ownership,
//!   permission bits, and "is this a regular file" come from `fstat` on the
//!   file that was actually opened, so nothing can swap the path between a
//!   check and the read.
//! - **Secret bytes are never left behind in freed memory.** [`SecretBuffer`]
//!   reads into a single, fixed-size allocation made up front -- it never
//!   grows, so there are no intermediate buffers freed un-wiped the way
//!   `Read::read_to_end` leaves them -- and zeroes that whole allocation
//!   (including unused capacity) on [`SecretBuffer::wipe`] and on drop.
