//! Linux administrative key-selection policy: `/etc/hkdfguard/policy.toml`
//! (overridable with `HKDFGUARD_POLICY_FILE`), giving system administrators
//! control over which KEK providers this crate may use and how the
//! provider chain is selected -- functionally equivalent to HKDFGuard's
//! Windows registry-based policy, extended to Linux-specific providers
//! (TPM2, PKCS#11, an externally provisioned secret, and an in-memory
//! ephemeral key). There is deliberately no software-backed (PKCS#8-file)
//! provider on this platform, so `require: pkcs8` -- the Windows-parity
//! token the original design sketch used for that concept -- is not part
//! of this vocabulary; a deployment without TPM2/PKCS#11 hardware should
//! provision a KEK via `external-secret` instead.
//!
//! Design: policy decisions are expressed primarily in terms of a
//! [`KeyProtectionLevel`] (an assurance tier) rather than naming specific
//! provider technologies, so a future provider can slot into an existing
//! level (see [`ProviderType::protection_level`]) and immediately be
//! usable under `require-level`/`minimum_protection` policies without any
//! change to this schema. Only the `require` mode and `preferred_order`
//! name providers directly, since that's their whole point.
//!
//! Separation of concerns: this module owns policy *parsing and
//! evaluation* only -- it has no knowledge of `KekProvider`/`KekHandle`
//! (the actual provider implementations in `crate::provider`) and knows
//! nothing about *how* a provider works -- it only carries the settings
//! each provider reads from the policy (module path, PIN file, TCTI...).
//! Its central question: given the provider types compiled
//! into this build, which of them, in what order, does policy currently
//! allow?
