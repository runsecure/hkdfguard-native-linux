//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! Rather than creating a child key and persisting it into the TPM's
//! limited persistent-handle range (which requires an owner-authorization
//! session for `EvictControl` and a local mapping from `service` to a
//! specific handle number that must never collide or leak), this provider
//! uses `TPM2_CreatePrimary` with a per-service `unique` seed value in the
//! public template.
//!
//! `TPM2_CreatePrimary` is *deterministic*: for a fixed hierarchy, fixed
//! public template (including the `unique` field, when the caller supplies
//! one) and unchanged TPM primary seed, it reproduces the exact same key
//! every time -- this is the same mechanism TPMs use internally to avoid
//! ever having to store a Storage Root Key. By setting `unique` to a
//! deterministic, non-secret, per-service label (`SHA-256(service)`), each
//! service gets its own key, reproducible on demand, with:
//!
//! - no persistent-handle bookkeeping or exhaustion risk,
//! - no local (service -> handle) mapping file to protect or lose,
//! - a private key that never leaves the TPM and is not derived from any
//!   host-identifying attribute -- it is derived from the TPM's own
//!   internal primary seed (injected at manufacture, never exported),
//!   using the service label purely for domain separation, exactly like
//!   this protocol already uses `service` as HKDF `info`. This is *not*
//!   the "derive a KEK from a machine fingerprint" pattern the spec
//!   prohibits: the secret input is the TPM's seed, not the label.
//!
//! The resulting primary key is loaded transiently for the duration of one
//! `ECDH_ZGen` call and flushed immediately after -- "persistent" here
//! means deterministically reproducible, not resident in NV storage.

//
// `TPM2_CreatePrimary` derives the primary object from the TPM's primary
// seed and the public template, of which the `unique` field is the part a
// caller controls. With `unique` set only to a public per-service label,
// the derivation depends on nothing secret to the *host*: any process
// that can open the TPM device can issue the identical CreatePrimary and
// obtain the identical key. An authValue cannot close that gap, because
// the authValue is not an input to the derivation -- an attacker simply
// re-derives the same key with an authValue of their own choosing.
//
// Folding a root-owned host secret into `unique` makes the derived key
// depend on the TPM seed *and* a file the attacker must also be able to
// read, so local TPM access alone is no longer enough.
//
// `inSensitive.data` would seem like the more natural channel for this,
// and it is *not* usable here: for an asymmetric object the TPM requires
// `TPMA_OBJECT.sensitiveDataOrigin` to be SET (the TPM must originate the
// private key itself; supplying sensitive data would mean supplying the
// private key, which is `TPM2_Import`'s job). Clearing it to pass
// `inSensitive.data` makes `TPM2_CreatePrimary` fail with
// `TPM_RC_ATTRIBUTES` -- verified against swtpm, not merely assumed.
// `unique` is the designed channel, and it is the same mechanism
// `validate_tpm_compatibility` already proves this TPM honors when it
// checks that different services derive different keys.
//
// The folded label is security-critical: anyone who learns it can derive
// the key, so it is treated like the secret itself (zeroized, never
// logged). It is not exposed by the TPM -- `out_public.unique` holds the
// *generated* public point, not the label fed into the request template.
//
// Because this changes the derivation, enabling it changes the KEK: DEKs
// wrapped before the secret was provisioned will fail their fingerprint
// check (status -16) rather than decrypt to garbage. See README.

//
// A discrete TPM sits on an LPC or SPI bus that an interposer can read
// byte-for-byte. `TPM2_ECDH_ZGen`'s response is the shared point Z for
// one payload; a captured response opens that payload (the per-payload
// hashed point in crypto.rs keeps it from opening any other), and an
// interposer that stays on the bus captures every subsequent one. A
// firmware TPM (Intel PTT, AMD fTPM) or a virtual TPM has
// no external bus, so this is pure overhead there -- hence the `auto`
// policy mode, which skips it only for known-internal manufacturers.
// That decision rests on `TPM_PT_MANUFACTURER`, read over the very bus in
// question, so an active interposer can forge it: `auto` defeats passive
// sniffing only. Once a salt key is pinned, `auto` stops asking and always
// encrypts (see `session_encryption_enabled`).
//
// The mechanism is the TPM 2.0 specification's own (Part 1 §19.6): an
// HMAC session started with `tpmKey` set to a TPM-resident decrypt key,
// so the session salt is encrypted to that key (one-pass ECDH) and the
// session key derived from it is never on the bus in cleartext; with
// `TPMA_SESSION.encrypt` set, the first response parameter -- here
// `outPoint`, i.e. Z -- is AES-128-CFB encrypted under a key derived from
// the session key. The cryptography lives in tpm2-tss's ESAPI layer,
// which tss-esapi wraps; this module only configures the session.
//
// Two things are load-bearing. An *unsalted* session's key derives from
// the two nonces, both visible on the bus, so the interposer computes it
// too -- salting is the entire defense, not an option. And the salt
// key's public half is itself learned over the bus at `TPM2_ReadPublic`,
// so an interposer can substitute its own and man-in-the-middle the
// session; that is what `tpm.pinned_session_salt_key_name` defeats, and
// why `required` mode refuses to run without a pin.
//
// Known limitation on a discrete TPM: parameter encryption covers only
// the *first* parameter of a command, and `TPM2_CreatePrimary`'s first
// parameter is `inSensitive`, not `inPublic`. The derivation-secret-
// derived `unique` label therefore still crosses the bus in cleartext
// when the service key is (re)created, and an interposer that captures
// it can re-derive the key itself. On a discrete TPM, the derivation
// secret protects against *software* attackers only; closing this needs
// a persisted, parent-encrypted key blob (`TPM2_Create` + `TPM2_Load`)
// rather than a derived primary.
