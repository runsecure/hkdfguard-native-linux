//! Provider abstraction, the priority-ordered selection chain, and the
//! optional provider allow-list policy.
//!
//! Every provider implements the identical ECDH -> HKDF-SHA512 -> AES-256-GCM
//! protocol (see `crypto.rs`); the only thing that differs between providers
//! is *where the persistent P-256 KEK private key lives* and *who performs
//! the ECDH operation*. PKCS#11/TPM2 providers never hand the private scalar
//! back to this crate -- `ecdh()` returns only the derived shared secret.
//!
//! There is deliberately no software-backed (locally-generated,
//! filesystem-encrypted-at-rest) provider: a deployment without TPM2 or
//! PKCS#11 hardware is expected to provision a KEK via the external-secret
//! provider instead. Ephemeral (in-memory, lost on restart) is never used
//! unless a policy file explicitly allows it -- see [`allowed_chain`].
//!
//! Providers no longer auto-create a KEK on first wrap/unwrap: `wrap` calls
//! [`select_existing`], which only *loads* an already-created KEK and fails
//! with [`crate::error::Error::KekNotFound`] if none exists yet; a KEK is
//! created only via the explicit [`create_kek`] (the `hkdfguard_create_kek`
//! C entry point). [`kek_exists`] answers "would `select_existing` succeed"
//! without creating anything. TPM2 is the one exception -- see its own
//! `kek_exists`/`load_kek` doc comments for why.
//!
//! The "allow-list" is now the full administrative policy engine in
//! `crate::policy` (`/etc/hkdfguard/policy.toml`) -- see [`allowed_chain`],
//! the sole point where every provider-selection function below crosses
//! from "what's compiled into this build" to "what policy currently
//! allows, and in what order."

// Each provider module is only compiled in when its feature is enabled, so
// a build with e.g. `tpm2` disabled never even sees TPM-related code.
