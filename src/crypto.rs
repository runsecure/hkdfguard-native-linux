//! The provider-agnostic wrap/unwrap protocol:
//! `ECDH(P-256, hashed per-payload point) -> HKDF-SHA512 -> AES-256-GCM`.
//!
//! Every provider (TPM2, PKCS#11, external secret, ephemeral) implements
//! the same [`crate::provider::KekHandle::ecdh`] contract, so
//! this module is the *only* place the actual wrap/unwrap algorithm is
//! implemented -- providers never see plaintext DEKs or derived keys.
//!
//! ## Why a hashed point rather than an ephemeral key
//!
//! The wrapping key comes from `Z = ECDH(KEK_priv, H_salt)`, where
//! `H_salt` is a P-256 point derived from the payload's random salt by
//! hashing (see [`payload_ecdh_point`]). Nobody knows the discrete log of
//! a hash output, so computing `Z` requires the KEK's private key, which
//! never leaves the TPM/HSM/secret file.
//!
//! This replaced an ECIES-style construction that used a fresh ephemeral
//! keypair per wrap. That version was forgeable: the KEK's *public* key
//! is not secret (on a TPM, anyone who can reach the device can
//! recompute it), and `ECDH(eph_priv, KEK_pub)` equals
//! `ECDH(KEK_priv, eph_pub)` -- so anyone holding the public key could
//! derive the wrapping key and mint a payload that unwrapped to a DEK of
//! their choosing. Binding more context into the AAD or KDF does not fix
//! that, because the forger controls those inputs too. The ephemeral key
//! also provided no forward secrecy here, since its public half was
//! stored in the payload.
//!
//! Only this host can now create a payload, and only this host can open
//! one -- which is exactly the deployment model: DEKs arrive from a build
//! server and are wrapped locally, and a wrapped payload is never meant
//! to be produced or read anywhere else.
//!
//! ## Why the point is per payload rather than one fixed `H`
//!
//! An earlier revision used a single fixed point `H` for every payload.
//! That made `Z` a constant per service: a single capture of `Z` -- from
//! a core dump, swap, a debugger attached by the same uid, or the bus of
//! a discrete TPM -- was enough to open every payload that service had
//! ever wrapped or would ever wrap, because the only other inputs to the
//! wrapping key are public. Hashing the salt to the curve instead makes
//! `Z` unique per payload, so a captured `Z` is worth exactly the one
//! payload it belongs to. Forgery resistance is unchanged: an attacker
//! holding `KEK_pub` still cannot compute `KEK_priv · H_salt` for any
//! salt. The salt is public, so the (non-constant-time) hashing is fine.
//!
//! ## What is bound
//!
//! The salt does double duty: it selects the ECDH point, and it is the
//! HKDF salt. Both the derived key and the AEAD are bound to
//! [`crate::payload::Payload::authenticated_bytes`] -- every byte of the
//! payload except the ciphertext -- plus the length-framed service name.
//! That authenticates the `provider_type` tag (so a payload cannot be
//! replayed as another provider's) and the KEK fingerprint (so the key
//! commits to the KEK's identity, rather than it only being checked).
//!
//! [`unwrap`] additionally checks the wrapped payload's embedded KEK
//! fingerprint (see [`kek_fingerprint`]) against the public key of the KEK
//! `service` currently resolves to, *before* attempting ECDH/AES-GCM --
//! see [`crate::error::Error::FingerprintMismatch`].
//!
//! Memory note: the DEK plaintext is kept in stack-allocated `[u8; DEK_LEN]`
//! buffers for the *entire* wrap/unwrap operation -- we deliberately use
//! `AeadInPlace::{encrypt,decrypt}_in_place_detached` instead of the more
//! convenient `Aead::{encrypt,decrypt}`, because the latter allocates a
//! heap `Vec<u8>` internally and, on the decrypt side, that `Vec` would
//! momentarily hold the *decrypted plaintext DEK* on the heap before we
//! could wrap it in `Zeroizing`. The in-place/detached API never touches
//! `alloc` at all for the DEK itself.
